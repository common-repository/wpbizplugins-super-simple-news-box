Add a small news box to your site, that is easily edited via a dashboard widget. Shows when it was last edited. Perfect for smaller notices and messages on your website!

== Description ==

Super Simple News Box lets you add a small and compact news box to your website. This news box is ideal for for example displaying shorter messages about what is currently going on with you, your company or similar. The box is easily edited through a dashboard widget, making it very useful for client work or similar, where the person intended to use it might not be that proficient in WordPress. With a dashboard widget, the editor for the news box is right in front of your eyes when you log in.

* Easily add a light weight and small news box
* Ideal for displaying short messages and current information that isn't big enough to motivate writing a blog post
* Output the news box by shortcode ([wpbizplugins_ssnb]) or a native WordPress widget
* Edited via a widget on the dashboard - great for using with clients and users who are not proficient with WordPress


**Instructions**

After you've installed and activated the plugin you'll find the editor for the news box on the dashboard. The general settings are located under Settings -> Super Simple News Box.

You can output the news box in two ways:

1. **By shortcode**: [wpbizplugins_ssnb] takes two options, title="Your title here" and show_updated="yes" or "no", for either showing or hiding when the box was last updated.
2. **By widget**: You'll find a native WordPress widget in your widget section.
